Hello World!
This is just a test to see if everything works!

The source code of this blog is hosted on my personal [Gitea](https://gitea.io/) instance.
I am using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and it is hopefully gonna work out well for a self-hosted, simple blog.
Also, the blog automatically built and deployed using [Drone](https://www.drone.io/).
All of the components are self-hosted on a little Kubernetes cluster (running on [K3s](https://k3s.io/)) on a [Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and a [ROCK 4 SE](https://rockpi.org/rockpi4).

More about my tech stack and hardware might said in a future post!
